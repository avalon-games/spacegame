Player Movement Controls:


Basic: 
a / d - left and right movement

space - jump

left click - launch a grapple to pull yourself towards the grappled point when it collides, release button to release grapple
- once you reach the desired position, the player will stop moving, often it is desired to release the hook early so you preserve the vertical momentum while pulling

right click - launch a grapple to swing yourself in a circular path around the grappled point when it collides, release button to release grapple

left shift - enter slowMo mode, playing the game at 0.5 speed, allows player to specify the grapple direction more easily while moving, release button to exit

---------------------------------------------------

Advanced movements:
- hold down a direction key (a/d) after releasing grapple to preserve the horizontal momentum before grapple was released if the direction key held is the same as the current movement direction


Note: there can only be one instance of each type of grapple in the air at a time (ex. you can't swing again until the swing's hook has returned back to you, but you can launch the pull hook while the swing's hook is released)
